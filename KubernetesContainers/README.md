# Cloud Build

Used to build images. For example from DockerFile.

# Container Registry

Artifact Registry provides both regional and multi-regional registry hosts. In Container Registry, you can only create a single registry host in a multi-region and all repositories in the registry share the same storage bucket. In Artifact Registry, each repository is a separate resource.

Container Registry is still supported but will only receive critical security fixes!

# Deployment Manager

Can be used to deploy marketplace solutions (elastic cloud, KAFKA!!! (Apache KafkaÂ® on Confluent Cloud), MongoDB, Maps APIs )

Example Kafka can easily be 2000$ per month (go self managed?)
